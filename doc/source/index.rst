Welcome to EMC²'s documentation!
=================================

The Earth Model Column Collaboratory (EMC²) is an open-source framework for
atmospheric model evaluation against observational data and model
intercomparisons. This framework is specifically designed to simulate the
Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) User Facility remote-sensing
measurements while being faithful to the representation of physical processes
in leading state-of-the-art models such as the Energy Exascale Earth System
Model (E3SM).
Detailed description of EMC² is provided in Silber et al. (GMD, 2022;
https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-901-2022).

EMC² Tutorial
=============

A tutorial for EMC² processing (in this case using E3SM model output) can
be found on the `ARM-Notebooks GitHub repository <https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/Open-Science-Workshop-2022/tutorials/EMC2_demo_w_E3SM.ipynb>`_
